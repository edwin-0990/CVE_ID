# *CVE-2025-25382: Payment Amount Tampering in Kerala Government Property Tax Payment Portal*

## Overview
This article highlights the discovery of a critical vulnerability in the Kerala Government's Property Tax Payment Portal, specifically in the Grama Panchayat Tax Quick Pay feature. The vulnerability allows attackers to arbitrarily modify the payment amount during transmission, leading to potential fraudulent payments and revenue loss for local governments.

## Vulnerability Details
**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-25382

**Vendor**: Information Kerala Mission

**Affected Application**: Kerala Government Property Tax Payment Portal (Sanchaya - 3.0.4)

**Affected Versions**: 3.0.4

**Vulnerability Type**: Payment Tampering

**Severity**: Critical

**Reported By**: Edwin Shajan

## Vulnerability Description

The Kerala Government Property Tax Payment Portal fails to properly validate payment amounts sent from the client to the server. Attackers can use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the payment amount during the transaction process. The server does not adequately verify or validate the tampered request, allowing attackers to manipulate the payment amount, which results in fraudulent payments or underpayment.

This vulnerability directly affects the financial integrity of transactions, allowing malicious users to alter the payment amounts, potentially causing revenue loss for the local government.

## Steps to Reproduce

 - Navigate to the Property Tax Payment Page: Visit the Kerala Government Property Tax Payment Portal at https://tax.lsgkerala.gov.in/epayment/.

 - Initiate a Property Tax Payment: Enter the required details to initiate a payment.

 - Intercept the Request: Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP request containing the payment amount.

 - Modify the Payment Amount: Change the payment amount to a lower value (e.g., set it to 1 Rs for proof of concept).

 - Forward the Request: Allow the modified request to proceed to the server and complete the payment process.

 - Inspect the Payment Success: After the payment is processed, intercept the success response and observe the modified payment amount.

 - Confirm the Tampering: The system will accept the modified amount, and a receipt will be issued based on the manipulated payment.


## Impact

The ability to tamper with payment amounts during transmission poses significant risks, including:

 - Attackers can pay less than the required amount, causing underpayment and financial loss for the local government.

 - Manipulating payment amounts can reduce the revenue collected, impacting the local government's financial resources.

This vulnerability violates basic principles of secure transaction processing and poses a critical threat to the integrity of financial systems.
