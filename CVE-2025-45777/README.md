# *CVE-2025-45777: Authentication Bypass in Chavara Matrimony Site v2.0*

## Overview
This article highlights the discovery of a critical authentication vulnerability in the Chavara Family Welfare Centre's Matrimony website. The vulnerability affects the OTP verification mechanism during account creation, allowing attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating the server response. This flaw enables unauthorized creation of accounts, opening the door for impersonation and fake identity registration.

## Vulnerability Details
**CVE ID**: CVE-2025-45777

**Vendor**: Chavara Family Welfare Centre

**Affected Application**: Chavara Matrimony Site - v2.0

**Affected Versions**: 2.0

**Vulnerability Type**: Incorrect Access Control

**Severity**: Critical

**Reported By**: Edwin Shajan

## Vulnerability Description

The OTP verification mechanism in the Chavara Matrimony website fails to securely validate the OTP confirmation response on the server side. Attackers can exploit this flaw by using a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP request during OTP verification and modify the response to simulate a successful OTP match. Since the server does not enforce strict OTP validation, the attacker is able to bypass the verification and complete the account registration without possessing a valid OTP.

This vulnerability allows malicious users to create fake profiles, which may be used for impersonation, spamming, or other deceptive activities on the platform.

## Steps to Reproduce

- Navigate to the Registration Page: Visit [Chavara Matrimony Site](https://www.chavaramatrimony.com/register-free).

- Initiate Account Registration: Start the sign-up process which triggers the sending of an OTP to the provided mobile number.

- Intercept the OTP Response: Use a tool like Burp Suite to capture the OTP verification request and response.

- Modify the Server Response: Alter the response to indicate a successful OTP validation (e.g., change the `400 Bad Request` value to `200 OK`, and value of `success` to 'true').

- Forward the Tampered Response: Turn of intercept to continue its normal functionality which will bypasses the OTP verification.

- Observe Account Creation: The system proceeds with registration and creates the account, even though the OTP was never actually validated (For both email OTP verification and Mobile OTP verification).

## Impact

The ability to bypass OTP verification during account creation introduces the following risks:

- Attackers can create fake or fraudulent profiles without needing access to the claimed mobile number/Email ID.

- Potential for impersonation and identity spoofing on the platform.

- Abuse of the system for spam or scams, damaging user trust and platform reputation.

- Erosion of the integrity and reliability of the matchmaking process.

This vulnerability undermines the platformâ€™s user verification process and needs to be addressed to prevent misuse.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

A detailed proof of concept demonstrates the OTP bypass technique. By intercepting and modifying the OTP verification response using a proxy tool, an attacker can simulate a successful OTP check and complete registration without receiving or entering a valid OTP.
